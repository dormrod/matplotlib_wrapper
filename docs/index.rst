mpl-scipub
=======================================
This is a package I developed during my PhD to try and simplify plotting with matplotlib, and generate publication-ready figures.
It replaces some of the idiosyncrasies of matplotlib's different plot types with a common interface,
and has support for 2D and 3D plotting.
